# Hello-World

Jacquelyn Brown here!

I am currently a High School Math teacher on my 4th year of teaching. I have enjoyed my journey as a Math teacher however am wondering if there is something else I might enjoy doing. Teaching is one of the hardest jobs I have ever done and often it leaves me exhausted and with nothing left to give my family when I get home. I know what people think, you only work part of the year and yes you are correct, however that part of the year I do work I work close to 60-80 hr a week and with a 7 month old at home it is not fair to her that I never see her or have the best of me to give her when I do get to see her. So I am here exploring the coding.
